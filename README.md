HW1 - A Set of Search Algs to solve the following problem: 
Consider an autonomous rover in a scientific mission on a planetary surface such as Mars or
Europa. Imagine that the rover has a 2D grid describing the map of its surroundings. Some cells in the
grid are of special scientific interest. The goal of the agent is to autonomously find a path from its current
location to one of those scientifically interesting areas. Some of the cells have rough terrain (e.g., high
slope, large rocks, slippery conditions). These cells can be considered “obstacles” to be avoided at all
costs.

Algorithms: Implement breadth-first search, depth-first search, A* search, iterative deepening, and greedy best first.
